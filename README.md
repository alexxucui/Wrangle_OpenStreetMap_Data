# Wrangle_OpenStreetMap_Data


Project Overview
You will choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project.

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
Parsing and gather data from popular file formats such as .json, .xml, .csv, .html
Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs
